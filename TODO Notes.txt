1. Visual Enhancements

    Color Gradients by Difficulty
        Easy = green, Medium = orange, Hard = red.
        Lets you spot which clusters you’re strongest in.

    Cluster Highlighting
        Group nodes by concept (e.g., all DP problems cluster together with a faint “halo” around them).
        You could use convex hulls or soft glowing groups.

    Interactive Filters
        Toggle checkboxes to only show problems of a certain difficulty or concepts.
        Makes it less overwhelming when you have 50+ problems.

    Problem Node Shapes
        Problems = spheres, Concepts = cubes (or other geometry).
        Visually separates data categories at a glance.

2. Utility Enhancements

    Problem Details Popup
        On click, open a floating card with:
            Problem description (or summary from your notes)
            Difficulty
            Link to problem site
            Your solution notes/snippets

    Search Bar
        Search by problem name or concept → auto-focus the node in the graph.

    Progress Tracking
        Add a status field (Solved, Reviewing, Needs Practice).
        Change node opacity or border glow based on status.

    Concept Heatmap
        Show “hot” concepts (lots of problems solved) vs. “cold” ones (few problems).
        Could make nodes bigger or more vibrant based on frequency.

3. Advanced / Wow Factor

    Animated Learning Path
        Select a concept → auto-animate a path through problems in increasing difficulty.

    Similarity Edges
        Beyond just concept links, calculate similarity between problems (e.g., “uses DP + backtracking”) → weighted edges.
        Would show hidden relationships between problems.

    Save / Resume View State
        Save your camera position + filters, so you can come back where you left off.

    Export Mode
        Snapshot the 3D graph as an image (or export JSON of your graph) → could share on LinkedIn to show progress visually.

ORDER:
    From a portfolio perspective, I’d recommend starting with:

    a. Color by difficulty
    b. Clickable problem detail popup
    c. Concept filter toggles
        
    Those 3 alone will make it way more useful and show off full-stack skills 
    (frontend rendering, backend data structuring, interactive UI).
