Problem: Running Sum of 1d Array
Difficulty: Easy
Concepts: Arrays, Prefix Sum
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/
Notes:
- Goal: compute the running sum of a 1D array
- Key insight: use a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums
- Alternate approaches: iterative in-place modification
- Instructions: Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]). Return the running sum of nums.
